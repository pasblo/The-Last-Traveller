# The-Last-Traveller
A game programmed on Python using Pygame based on games like Galaga and Space Invaders

This game was created as my first big project when i was 15 years old. It was usefull to me because i learnt how to manage a project and how does a game work,
at the end it turned out to be a aceptable game, with user management using Sqlite3, 15 different levels, a settings window... 

Examples of the game working can be found on the "Imagenes del juego" folder on the repository, and i have also created a video gameplay that can
be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N2rPe4P73s.

For running the game it is needed Python 3.4.0 and pygame 1.9.4 installed.
